# **Turtle Race & Sketch Programs**

This repository contains two separate Python programs using the `turtle` module:

1. **Turtle Race** – A simple racing game where multiple turtles compete, and the user places a bet on the winner.
2. **Sketch Program** – A basic drawing program that allows the user to control a turtle using keyboard inputs.

## **Sketch Program**

### **Description**

The Sketch program allows the user to control a turtle on the screen using arrow keys. The turtle can move forward, backward, and rotate, creating sketches dynamically.

### **Features**

- **Arrow Key Controls:** Move the turtle in different directions.
- **Canvas Reset:** Press `C` to reset the drawing.
- **Black Background & White Turtle:** A simple visual design for clarity.

### **How to Run**

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python sketch.py
   ```
3. Use the following keys to control the turtle:
   - **Up Arrow:** Move forward.
   - **Down Arrow:** Move backward.
   - **Left Arrow:** Turn counterclockwise.
   - **Right Arrow:** Turn clockwise.
   - **C Key:** Reset the canvas.
